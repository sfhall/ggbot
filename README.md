# Gamer Girl Simulator 
Have you ever wanted to feel like a real life gamer girl?
Now you can!

I collected over 100 of the nice messages and comments I recieved and shoved that into a markov bot! 
Now you can expierence the nice (and not creepy!) compliemtents from guys online, just like any other gamer girl.

How to use: 
1. Download both the python and text file. Make sure python is downloaded on your computer!
2. Open the terminal of your choice and navigate to the file that gg.py is located in.
3. Type "sudo pip install markovify" to install necessary libraries.
4. Type "python gg.py" and enjoy feeling like a true gamer girl!
